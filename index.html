			<h2>Introduction:</h2>
			<p>
				Hello, welcome to my web page.  I have been in telecommunications software development
				for 36 years. I have been involved in all phases of software development.
				You may be thinking this guy is a dinosaur, well I have a saying: "Just because there
				is snow on the roof, doesn't mean there isn't a fire inside".
			</p>
			<p>
				Throughout the years I worked with many interesting people and on numerous interesting projects.
				<ul>
					<li> Worked with the ATF/FBI after the very first bombing that occurred at the World Trade Center.</li>
					<li> Worked on a satellite solution for cell phone service when Hurricane Katrina
						 hit the gulf coast</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Please feel free to view and make comments on my web page.
